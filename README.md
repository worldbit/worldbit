What is Worldbit?
----------------

Worldbit is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Worldbit uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. Worldbit Core is the name of the open
source software which enables the use of this currency.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
